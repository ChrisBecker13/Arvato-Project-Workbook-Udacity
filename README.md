# Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains the project files for the Customer Segmentation project, part of the Udacity Arvato Bertelsmann Data Science Nanodegree program. The project aims to perform customer segmentation and analysis using demographic data.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to gain insights into the characteristics of the general population and identify potential customer segments. By applying machine learning techniques and clustering algorithms, we can uncover patterns in the data that help in understanding customer behavior, improving marketing strategies, and driving business growth.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in this project:

- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- Seaborn: for enhanced data visualization

## File in the Repository

- `Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, analysis and the unsupervised and supervised learning task of targeting customers for a marketing campaign
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its contents

## Summary of Results

Through this project, we successfully performed customer segmentation and analyzed the demographics of the general population. By using unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, we identified distinct customer segments based on demographic features. Additionally, we utilized supervised learning algorithms to predict potential customers for a marketing campaign.
